// to run: npx cypress open

if verification timed out message occur 

This issue is not related with Cypress version.

To resolve this issue, you need to increase default timeout. For this, go to below path: node_modules\cypress\lib\tasks\verify.js

Open verify.js, search variable VERIFY_TEST_RUNNER_TIMEOUT_MS. By default it should be 30000. Change it to 100000
